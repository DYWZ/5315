      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an open source project initially developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Commercial and open source software projects rely on Git for version control. With VCS, everyone on the team can work on any file individually at any time. VCS will later allow you to merge all changes into a common version. VCS enhances team collaboration. Even though the version control system recognizes that there is only one project, VCS packages all past versions and variants. When problems arise, people can find the source of the problem by having information about earlier versions available at any time through VCS. VCS also can restore previous versions. Each time a new version of a project is saved, VCS asks people to provide a short description of what has changed, which documents the evolution of different versions. A side effect of using a distributed VCS like Git is that it can be used as a backup. If someone's central server fails (and your backup drive fails), just restore one of your teammates' local Git repositories.</p>
