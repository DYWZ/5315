      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool that can use containers to create, deploy, and run applications more easily. A container is a standard software unit that packages code and all its dependencies together, allowing applications to run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Docker container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that contains code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and Settings to support the running of applications. With the help of the container, a developer can run an application on any other Linux machine without worrying about the difference between running the machine's custom Settings and the machine used to write the code.
