      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool that uses containers to create, deploy, and run applications more efficiently. A container is a standard software unit that packages code and all its dependencies together, allowing applications to run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Docker container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that contains code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and Settings to support the running of applications. With the help of the container, a developer can run an application on any other Linux machine without worrying about the difference between running the device's custom Settings and the device used to write the code.

The software in the virtual machine does not have a permanent impact on the computer's hard drive, which provides an ideal environment for creating operating system backups, testing other operating systems, and the like for accessing virus-infected data.
